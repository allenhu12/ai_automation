# Project Requirement Description - Ruckathon2025

## Project Summary

**Bug and Test Case Analysis System MVP** - An AI-assisted analysis system that identifies test coverage gaps between existing Robot Framework test suites and reported bugs, then generates new test cases to improve coverage.

## Business Context

### Current Problem
The zfrwbot_218 test automation framework contains extensive Robot Framework test suites for Ruckus wireless network equipment testing. However:

1. **Manual Coverage Analysis**: Determining whether reported bugs are covered by existing tests requires manual review of hundreds of test cases
2. **Gap Identification**: Identifying which bugs lack adequate test coverage is time-consuming and error-prone  
3. **Test Generation**: Creating new Robot Framework test cases for uncovered scenarios requires significant manual effort
4. **Enterprise Constraints**: Cannot use external LLM APIs due to security policies, limiting automation options

### Business Value
- **Improved Test Coverage**: Systematic identification and closure of test coverage gaps
- **Time Savings**: Reduce manual analysis time from hours to minutes
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure critical bugs have corresponding automated tests
- **Team Productivity**: Enable QA team to focus on high-value testing activities

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **QA Engineers**: Responsible for test case creation and maintenance
- **Test Automation Engineers**: Need to expand test coverage systematically
- **Development Team**: Require quick assessment of bug-to-test coverage

### User Personas
1. **Sarah (Senior QA Engineer)**: Needs to quickly assess if new bugs are already covered by existing tests
2. **Mike (Test Automation Lead)**: Wants to identify systematic gaps in test coverage
3. **David (Developer)**: Needs to understand which areas lack adequate test coverage

## Functional Requirements

### 1. File Processing Capabilities

#### 1.1 Robot Framework XML Report Processing
- **Requirement**: Parse Robot Framework `output.xml` files from zfrwbot_218 test runs
- **Input**: XML files containing test execution results, test case names, keywords, and suite structure
- **Processing**: Extract test case metadata, execution status, and coverage areas
- **Output**: Structured data representing current test coverage

#### 1.2 Bug Report Processing  
- **Requirement**: Process bug reports in simple text format
- **Input**: Text files containing bug descriptions with format: "Bug #ID: Description"
- **Processing**: Extract bug IDs, descriptions, and categorize by component/area
- **Output**: Structured bug data for analysis

### 2. Analysis Capabilities

#### 2.1 Coverage Gap Analysis
- **Requirement**: Identify which bugs are not adequately covered by existing tests
- **Process**: AI-assisted comparison of bug descriptions against test case coverage
- **Output**: Classification of bugs as "covered" or "uncovered" with confidence scores
- **Success Criteria**: Achieve >80% accuracy in coverage classification

#### 2.2 Test Case Generation
- **Requirement**: Generate new Robot Framework test cases for uncovered bugs
- **Process**: AI-assisted creation of test cases following zfrwbot_218 conventions
- **Output**: Valid `.robot` files ready for integration into existing test suites
- **Success Criteria**: Generated tests follow existing naming conventions and use appropriate keywords

### 3. Web Interface Requirements

#### 3.1 File Upload Interface
- **Requirement**: Simple web interface for uploading test reports and bug files
- **Features**: 
  - Drag-and-drop file upload
  - File validation (XML format for test reports, text for bug reports)
  - Upload progress indication
- **Constraints**: No complex frontend framework, vanilla HTML/JavaScript only

#### 3.2 Results Display
- **Requirement**: Present analysis results in user-friendly format
- **Features**:
  - Coverage percentage visualization
  - List of covered vs uncovered bugs
  - Preview of generated test cases
  - Download links for generated `.robot` files
- **Success Criteria**: Results display within 30 seconds of analysis completion

### 4. Integration Requirements

#### 4.1 zfrwbot_218 Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Generated test cases must integrate seamlessly with existing framework
- **Standards**:
  - Follow TLID-XXXXX naming convention
  - Use existing keyword libraries from `resources/keywords/`
  - Compatible with current test suite structure
  - Include appropriate tags ([Tags] regression, generated, etc.)
- **Success Criteria**: Generated tests execute successfully in zfrwbot_218 environment

#### 4.2 AI Processing Integration
- **Requirement**: Leverage Cursor IDE's built-in AI capabilities for analysis
- **Process**: Manual workflow where developer uses Cursor AI with structured prompts
- **Output**: Consistent analysis results following predefined templates
- **Constraints**: No external API calls, local processing only
