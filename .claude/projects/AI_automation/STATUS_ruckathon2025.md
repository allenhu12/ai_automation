# Current Status - Ruckathon2025

## Project Overview
**Bug and Test Case Analysis System MVP** - Ruckathon 2025 project to create AI-assisted analysis system for zfrwbot_218 Robot Framework test coverage.

## Current Phase: Design and Planning ✅

### Completed Tasks ✅
1. **Project Initialization** (2025-07-29 3:42 PM)
   - Set up project structure in `.claude/projects/project_ruckathon2025/`
   - Created foundational documents framework

2. **Requirements Analysis** (2025-07-29 3:45 PM)
   - Analyzed comprehensive system design document (`Claude-Test Case Analysis System Design.md`)
   - Reviewed zfrwbot_218 test automation framework structure
   - Identified real-world constraints and opportunities

3. **High Level Design (HLD)** (2025-07-29 3:52 PM) ✅
   - Documented MVP system architecture
   - Defined 4-component design: Web Interface → FastAPI Backend → File Storage → Manual AI Processing
   - Established integration requirements with zfrwbot_218
   - Created file structure and success metrics

4. **Project Requirements Document (PRD)** (2025-07-29 3:58 PM) ✅
   - Defined functional requirements for file processing and analysis
   - Established non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
   - Documented technical constraints and enterprise limitations
   - Set clear success criteria and demo requirements

5. **Documents Creation in Working Directory** (2025-07-29 4:05 PM) ✅
   - Created HLD_ruckathon2025.md in current working directory
   - Created PRD_ruckathon2025.md in current working directory
   - Created STATUS_ruckathon2025.md in current working directory
   - All documents now accessible via `ls *.md` in project workspace

### Key Design Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: File-based manual workflow leveraging Cursor AI (addresses enterprise constraints)
- **Technology Stack**: FastAPI + vanilla HTML/JS (minimal dependencies, fast development)
- **Integration**: Direct compatibility with zfrwbot_218 Robot Framework conventions
- **Scope**: 8-hour MVP focused on core functionality demonstration

## Next Phase: Implementation

### Ready to Begin Implementation ⏳
- **Total Estimated Time**: 8 hours
- **Target**: Working demonstration by end of day
- **Files to Create**: 4 main components (~500 lines total code)

### Implementation Plan
```
Hour 1-2: FastAPI Backend (main.py)
├── File upload endpoints
├── XML parsing integration  
├── Job queue management
└── Results serving

Hour 3-4: Analysis Engine (analysis_engine.py)
├── Robot Framework XML parsing
├── Bug report text processing
├── AI prompt generation
└── Data structuring

Hour 5-6: Web Interface (static/index.html)
├── File upload interface
├── Status tracking
├── Results display
└── Download functionality

Hour 7-8: Processing Script + Demo (process_analysis.py)
├── Manual AI workflow
├── Cursor integration
├── Output generation
└── End-to-end demonstration
```

## Current Blockers
None - Ready to proceed with implementation.

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Well-defined requirements and architecture
- **Manageable Scope**: Focused MVP with clear constraints  
- **Validated Approach**: Leverages existing zfrwbot_218 test data
