# Test Coverage Analysis for JIRA Issues

## Overview
Analyze the following 4 JIRA issues for test coverage gaps and generate Robot Framework test cases.

## JIRA Issues to Analyze:


### Issue 1: UN-12686
**Title**: User login fails with special characters in password
**Status**: Open
**Priority**: High
**Description**: When users attempt to login with passwords containing special characters such as ampersands (&), less-than (<), or greater-than (>) symbols, the authentication fails with an error message "Invalid credentials".
                
                Steps to reproduce:
                1. Create user account with password containing special characters
                2. Attempt to login with these credentials
                3. Login fails with "Invalid credentials" error
                
             ...

**Components**: Authentication, Security
**Labels**: special-characters, login, security

**Recent Comments**:
- tech.lead@example.com: Initial investigation shows the issue is in the password encoding during authentication. The special characters are not being properly escaped before validation....
- security.team@example.com: This is a security concern as it affects user authentication. Recommend implementing proper input sanitization and encoding for special characters....


### Issue 2: UN-12687
**Title**: File upload size limit not enforced properly
**Status**: In Progress
**Priority**: Medium
**Description**: The system allows users to upload files larger than the configured maximum size limit (10MB). This can lead to storage issues and potential security vulnerabilities.
                
                Current behavior:
                - System shows 10MB limit in UI
                - Files up to 50MB are actually accepted
                - No proper error handling for oversized files
                
                Impact:
                - Server storage fills up quickly
                - Perfor...

**Components**: File Upload, Validation
**Labels**: validation, file-upload, performance

**Recent Comments**:
- dev.team@example.com: Started work on implementing proper file size validation. Will need to check both client-side and server-side validation....

## Analysis Instructions:

1. **Identify Test Scenarios**: For each issue, identify what test scenarios should exist
2. **Find Coverage Gaps**: Determine which scenarios are missing from current test suite
3. **Generate Test Cases**: Create Robot Framework test cases for missing coverage
4. **Prioritize Tests**: Rank test cases by risk and business impact

## Expected Output Format:

Save results as JSON in target_folder/ with this structure:
```json
{
  "analysis_summary": {
    "total_issues": 4,
    "high_priority_gaps": 0,
    "test_cases_generated": 0,
    "analysis_date": "2025-07-30T10:45:11.290248"
  },
  "coverage_gaps": [
    {
      "issue_key": "ISSUE-123",
      "gap_description": "Missing error handling test",
      "risk_level": "High",
      "suggested_test": "Test Case Description"
    }
  ],
  "generated_tests": [
    {
      "test_name": "Test Invalid Input Handling",
      "issue_keys": ["ISSUE-123"],
      "priority": "High",
      "robot_code": "Robot Framework test code here"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Robot Framework Test Template:
Use this template for generating test cases:

```robot
*** Test Cases ***
Test Case Name
    [Tags]    {issue_key}    {priority}
    [Documentation]    Test description based on JIRA issue
    
    Given Initial State
    When Action Performed  
    Then Expected Result
    
*** Keywords ***
Given Initial State
    # Setup code
    
When Action Performed
    # Test action
    
Then Expected Result
    # Verification
```
